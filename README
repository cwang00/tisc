TISC is a program written in C under Linux to calculate the 2D (planform)
flexure of the  lithosphere, fluvial transport along, and, in particular, to
numerically simulate the formation of foreland basins. Please read the
'tisc/doc/tisc.info.txt' file to know more about TISC. TISC is the 3D version of
the cross-section (pseudo 2D) numerical model tAo, and uses the finite 
difference technique.

Disclaimer: TISC is a tool developed for my own research with no professional 
programmers involved, the code is thus not so user-friendly, and I cannot 
guarantee my assistance in case of  trouble. See other warnings in the license 
file tisc/doc/LICENSE.txt.

See license details in the documentation at tisc/doc/LICENSE.txt.

TO INSTALL TISC:

TISC has been developed in C under Linux, and is ready for compilation in a Mac 
Linux environment.

-Uncompress and untar the file containing TISC using the unix command 
	'gunzip -c tisc.tar.gz | tar -xvf -'
this will create directory 'tisc/' in your current directory.

-Modify compiling options by editing 'tisc/config.mk' and 'tisc/src/Makefile'.

-Compile typing 'make' in the main directory. This will create the executable 
tisc in the tisc/bin/ directory. You should then put tisc/bin/ and tisc/script/ 
in your shell path.

-Optionally install GMT free-ware software (used for graphic output) and put 
its bin/ directory in your path. This should work:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install gmt ksh csh tofrodos

-Try examples of running TISC going to directory 'tisc/demo/'. This will allow
you to be sure that the code is working properly. Check that the graphic
output is correctly produced in the postscript output files (*.ps)

-Read the 'doc/tisc.info.txt' file to know more about how to use TISC.
