This file contains instructions to run some examples of using TISC. The
aim of these examples is to show that TISC is able to solve different
isostatic, tectonic and surface transport contexts. The examples are sorted 
from the most simple scenarios to the most detailed and specific about 
foreland basin formation.

All Postscripts in these directories are the result of the tisc.gmt.job script,
which contains GMT commands. It is automatically invoked when the parameter 
switch_ps = 1.


EXAMPLES: 

1) In this first example, TISC can be used as an external calculator of
lithospheric flexure.  Run this in the present directory and you will get the
deflection in the standard output: 

	tisc -Q1st_example_load.xyp -N11 -D-2.5e5/2.5e5/-2.5e5/2.5e5 -qmode_interp=0

This reads x[m],y[m],pressure[Pa] from 'testload1.xyp' and writes the 
deflection to the standard output. TISC will use the domain defined with -D and
a 11x11 discretization grid. Add -T5000 to get the result for a 5km-thick flexural
plate.

2) Now do the same using testload2.xyp, which contains the same load as before but 
in a more compact format using mode_interp=4 (see doc/tisc.info.txt, at the end of 
section 'Inputs').

	tisc -Q2nd_example_load.xyp -N11 -D-2.5e5/2.5e5/-2.5e5/2.5e5 -qmode_interp=4

You will obtain exactly the same result as before. The deflection at the centre
[0,0] is 675.1 m, whereas using -N51 yields 711.0 m, and with -N101 yields 
712.2 m (as a result of changing resolution and precision).

The comming examples are in subdirectories.  Once you go to the directory
corresponding to each of the following examples, you can check and modify the
inputs (files with an upppercase name extension).


3) ../demo/3_flexure/
Now let's run a model by defining a project with input an output files. Let the 
project's name be 'flex'. 
Suppose you need to calculate the deflection of a 20 km-thick plate under a
square load of 1000 m thickness and 2850 kg/m3 in its central area, where no
moment is supported. This plate will be assumed to rest on a fuid asthenosphere 
for which the default density specified in flex.PRM will be used. 
The next command solves this problem using 51x51 nodes of discretization:
	tisc flex -Pc
The 20km thickness is also specified in the flex.PRM file, but try adding 
-T5000 to the command to override that value and obtain the results for a 
different elastic thickness.  

4) ../demo/4_river_transp/
	This setup calculates the orographic precipitation produced by a vocano.
	Command:
	tisc conic_island -tf10 -Pc
	#-Pc makes a jpeg image at each time step.
	#-tf10 ignores the final time in the PRM file and set it to 10 Myr. 

5) ../demo/5_lakes/
	Command:	tisc 2lakes 

6) ../demo/6_deformation/
	Commands:
	tisc demo -Pc #to have a jpg produced at each time step
	tisc demo -F -v-2850/3.14/31.4 -tf20  #to change velocity of blocks with a 2850 density
	tisc demo -F -v3/2.17/21.7 -tf25  #to change velocity of block 3
	tisc demo -F -S1/1 -tf -tf30  #to move block 1 up by 1 position

7) ../demo/7_climate/
	Command: 	
	tisc climate -Pc | tee climate.outputscreen.txt

8) ../demo/8_Ebro_evol/
	This is the Ebro Basin model published in G-C et al., JGR, 2003.
	Command: 	
	tisc Ebro_evol -Pc"-page 1040x700-210-580 -density 180 -crop 1040x1000+0+0" | tee Ebro_evol.screen

	Try inhibiting the surface processes with this:
			tisc Ebro_evol -qerosed_model=0 -qhydro_model=0

9) ../demo/9_Iberian_drainage/
	This calculates the present drainage of the Iberian peninsula.
	Command: 	
	tisc Iberia_present
